When unequal actual and expected values are tested, a short description of the similarities and differences are printed in the REPL. First, leading identical sections are displayed, followed by differences, and then finally identical ending sections.  ### How to use  ```;; clojure test file(ns my-test-ns    (:require [clojure.test :refer [is]])    (:require [text-diff :refer [are-vars-eq]]))(deftest test-html-values []  (let [actual-value   "<same>DIFFERENT</same>"        expected-value "<same>different</same>"        [diff-actual diff-expected] (are-vars-eq actual-value expected-value)]    (is (= diff-actual diff-expected))))```      ```;; repl output|START|"<same>"|DIFF1|"e>DIFFERENT</"|DIFF2|"e>different</"|  END|"</same>"      expected (= diff-actual diff-expected)actual (not (= "DIFFERENT" "different"))false```      ###Examples![Hard to see \n versus \r](images/a_r_vs_n.png)---![Hard to see 1 versus L](images/b_1_vs_l.png)---![Hard to see c versus X](images/c_out_order.png)---![Hard to see X versus Y](images/d_lots_x_y.png)---![Hard to see 1/3 versus 1/4](images/e_map_3_4.png)---![Hard to see ending \n](images/f_end_n.png)---![Hard to see 8 versus 7](images/g_numbers_7_8.png)---Odd string behavior that is to be expected from string differences inside maps/sets/lists/vectors.
